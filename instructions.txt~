The following are the instructions you need to complete in order to use the module, the stand in policy machine, and the testing code in the repository.


Editing and compiling the kernel:

1) In order to use the kernel module as it stands, we have to make a few small edits to a copy of the linux operating system, compile the edited version, and boot the edited version.

2) Start by cloning the appropriate git repo: git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-xenial.git

3) Add:
   - EXPORT_SYMBOL(do_execve) to ~/ubuntu-xenial/fs/exec.c
   - EXPORT_SYMBOL(getname) to ~/ubuntu-xenial/fs/namei.c

4) Check source code in system settings"->"software & updates"->"Source code" to allow for some library installs

5) Run sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

6) Run sudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)

7) To compile the OS code, change into the topmost directory (ubuntu-xenial) and run:
   - fakeroot debian/rules clean
   - fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic binary-perarch

8) Once compilation is complete, there should be several linux-*.deb files in the home directory. In order to use these, you must run the follwing command:
   - sudo dpkg -i linux*4.8.0-17.19*.deb

   The numbers in this command may need to be changed to match the numbers in your own *.deb files.
